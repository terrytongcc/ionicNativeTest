## nativeTest: Ionic Native Plugins Testing Project

This is my testing project for Ionic native plugins.

I start to pickup Ionic recently and fascinated by those fantasic native plugins, so i start trying them one by one and this project is the "study-in-progress" product.

## Installation

Just download or clone this project, run "npm install" to install all modules, and you're good to go. 

Since I'm focused on Android platform, this may not work well on iOS platform so test and tweak as you like.

For those of you who are new to Ionic, please take a look at their <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/installation/">docs</a> to get started first.
